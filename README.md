# Azure Static Web App – HTML + GitHub Actions + Bicep

This project is a minimal HTML landing page deployed as an Azure Static Web App.  
It uses **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD and **Bicep** for Infrastructure as Code.

## ✨ What's Included
- `index.html`: The simple front-end being served
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow to automate deployments
- `.github/workflows/main.bicep`: Bicep template to provision the Static Web App and link it to the GitHub repo

## 📘 Lessons Learned
Setting up the CLI, working through permission issues, debugging environment path problems — these were all part of the process. It’s helped sharpen how I troubleshoot and structure projects from scratch.
